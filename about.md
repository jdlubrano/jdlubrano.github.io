### About The Code Less Traveled

{: .text-justified }
The Code Less Traveled is my blog and I mean for it to be a story of mistakes
that I have made and what I have learned from them.  The best piece of advice
that I ever received was to _"Cherish my mistakes"_.
So, feel free to cherish my mistakes, especially if it means avoiding your own.

### About Me

<div class="text-justified" markdown="1">
  My name is Joel Lubrano and I am a software developer, but I never said that
  I was any good.

  I currently work with [Stitch Fix](https://stitchfix.com).  My work at
  Stitch Fix deals primarily with Ruby on Rails, RabbitMQ, and third-party
  integrations.  The Stitch Fix ecosystem is extremely distributed; it feels
  like someone is creating a new microservice every week.

  Before I joined Stitch Fix, I worked for a startup called, MakeTime; MakeTime
  was a Ruby on Rails shop with a sprinkle of Python here and there.  MakeTime
  has since been purchased by [Xometry](https://www.xometry.com/).  Prior to my
  years at MakeTime, I was a software engineer with Lexmark International.
  Most of my work at Lexmark was with Java, PHP, and MeteorJS.
