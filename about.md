### About this Blog

The Code Less Traveled is meant to be a story of mistakes that I have made and
what I have learned from them.  The best piece of advice that I ever received
was to <em>"Cherish my mistakes"</em>.  So, feel free to cherish my mistakes
especially if it means avoiding your own.

### About Me

My name is Joel Lubrano and I am a software developer, but I never said that
I was any good.

I currently work with [MakeTime](https://maketime.io) in
Lexington, Kentucky as we attempt to revolutionize American manufacturing.
My work at MakeTime deals primarily with Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, and a
sprinkle of Python here and there.  I wrote one project in Elixir just to
give that a whirl (Elixir is a lot of fun if you ever have the chance to
work with it).

Before I joined MakeTime, I was a software engineer with Lexmark International.
Most of my work at Lexmark was with Java, PHP, and MeteorJS.
