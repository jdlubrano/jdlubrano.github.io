### About this Blog

{: .text-justified }
The Code Less Traveled is meant to be a story of mistakes that I have made and
what I have learned from them.  The best piece of advice that I ever received
was to _"Cherish my mistakes"_.  So, feel free to cherish my mistakes,
especially if it means avoiding your own.

### About Me

<div class="text-justified" markdown="1">
  My name is Joel Lubrano and I am a software developer, but I never said that
  I was any good.

  I currently work with [MakeTime](https://maketime.io) in
  Lexington, Kentucky as we attempt to revolutionize American manufacturing.
  My work at MakeTime deals primarily with Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, and a
  sprinkle of Python here and there.  I wrote one project in Elixir just to
  give that a whirl (Elixir is a lot of fun if you ever have the chance to
  work with it).

  Before I joined MakeTime, I was a software engineer with Lexmark International.
  Most of my work at Lexmark was with Java, PHP, and MeteorJS.

  It is altogether more likely that you will answer mine, however
